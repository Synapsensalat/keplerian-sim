//! # Keplerian Orbital Mechanics
//! This library crate contains logic for Keplerian orbits, similar to the ones
//! you'd find in a game like Kerbal Space Program.  
//!
//! Keplerian orbits are special in that they are more stable and predictable than
//! Newtonian orbits. In fact, unlike Newtonian orbits, Keplerian orbits don't use
//! time steps to calculate the next position of an object. Keplerian orbits use
//! state vectors to determine the object's *full trajectory* at any given time.\
//! This way, you don't need to worry about lag destabilizing Keplerian orbits.  
//!
//! However, Keplerian orbits are significantly more complex to calculate than
//! just using Newtonian physics. It's also a two-body simulation, meaning that
//! it doesn't account for external forces like gravity from other bodies or the
//! engines of a spacecraft.
//!
//! The way Kerbal Space Program handles this is to have an "on-rails" physics
//! system utilizing Keplerian orbits, and an "active" physics system utilizing
//! Newtonian two-body physics.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//! This crate provides four main structs:
//! - [`Orbit`]: A struct representing an orbit around a celestial body.
//!   Each instance of this struct has some cached data to speed up
//!   certain calculations, and has a larger memory footprint.
//! - [`CompactOrbit`]: A struct representing an orbit around a celestial body.
//!   This struct has a smaller memory footprint than the regular `Orbit` struct,
//!   but some calculations may take 2~10x slower because it doesn't save any
//!   cached calculations.
//!
//! We used to have `body`, `universe`, and `body_presets` modules, however these
//! were removed from the main library because some programs have different
//! needs on what to store on each body. The code was moved to the `simulate`
//! example file in the repository:
//! <https://github.com/Not-A-Normal-Robot/keplerian-sim/blob/0d60ed756dc6b09c60d779167cfa0e3346e09213/examples/simulate.rs>
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use glam::DVec3;
//!
//! use keplerian_sim::{Orbit, OrbitTrait};
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! // Create a perfectly circular orbit with a radius of 1 meter
//! let orbit = Orbit::default();
//! assert_eq!(orbit.get_position_at_time(0.0), DVec3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));
//! # }
//! #
//! ```
